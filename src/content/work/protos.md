Worked on NEXUS, a unified cyber risk management platform. Used React and Material UI to build an admin dashboard complete with charts, interactive tables, forms, etc.

I worked on NEXUS for the second time in 2024. Modernized the codebase and helped reducing the Frontend bundle size from 3.5MB down to 1.7MB.
