I worked here for a while, so I'm going to list some things that I think worth mentioning:

- [**Fit.Cells**](https://www.fitcells.com), a gym platform that uses a pay-as-you-go payment model. I managed to migrate the codebase from using CRA/JavaScript to Vite/TypeScript (React, Material UI)
- [**Xcidic Company Profile**](https://xcidic.com). We redesigned the website to make it look more modern. We also migrated the codebase from using CRA to Next.js. We also added a lot of cool animations! (React, Material UI)
- [**Gelora**](https://www.gelora.id), a mobile app for sports venue booking. I learned a bit of React Native here.
- [**Sribu**](https://www.sribu.com), an Indonesian freelancer platform. I was part of the team tasked to redesign/rewrite the entire platform for 2.0 release.

And lastly, I served as the Acting Head of Technology Division for a month in January 2024. During this time, I gained experience managing human resources for approximately five projects. Additionally, I assisted in running a free Golang course offered by our company to two selected backend developers.
